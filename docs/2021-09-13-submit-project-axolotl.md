## Inspiration

The project started out of a concrete requirements in our everyday job. However, since we are doing secret stuff in our workday, we pivoted the idea to a project which allows traceability of wine bottles.

## What it does

The app allows to create QR Code programmatically and insert them into a Confluence page. The idea is to use them to attach to physical items (for instance, a wine bottle) so that users of the item can access online, up-to-date information about such item. We demonstrated it with a concrete use case for wine, but of course this is just one example of application.

## How we built it

The AXOLOTL application leverages the
"Forge QR Code" example at
<https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/workspace/projects/FE>.

We made a few small extensions to the original sources, for instance the capability to render not just the QR Code but also a few additional attributes in cleartext. This can hint end users that they may get more details by scanning the QR Code.

## Challenges we ran into

Mostly time... We assumed we had more spare time over the weekend, but this was not the case. For instance, one of us was busy harvesting grapes at the in-laws vineyard - by the way, that was the main inspiration for the app :-) 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

That we managed to complete the submission just a couple of hours before the deadline...

## What we learned

That planning is essential to hit milestones!

## What's next for AXOLOTL

Who knows? Maybe we will extend the project for our actual use cases in our main job?

#### \* Built with

_What languages, frameworks, platforms, cloud services, databases, APIs, or other technologies did you use?_

```text
We developed the code for this project in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.x and the
[Forge Framework](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/).

Additionally, the [qrcode-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode-svg) package
was used to render QR Codes.

For the purpose of Codegeist 2021 we made no use of databases or backend APIs,
even though the app can be easily extended to connect to public and private databases and backends.

The created App was deployed to Atlassian Cloud under the space:
<https://teti.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AXT/overview>
```
